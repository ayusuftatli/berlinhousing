I am looking for an apartment in Berlin for the third time in my life. For the first two times, I was looking for a place to hang my hat. So, I was not very picky about it. This time I am pickier because I have leverage as my current apartment is decent and I donâ€™t need to move out anytime soon.

What I want at the end is an affordable apartment near my office. This means I am looking for an apartment with a cold rent below the Berlin average, in Kreuzberg or in the quarters nearby.

My questions are:

1. How does Kreuzberg, the quarter and borough compare to others in Berlin?
2. Should I get a studio apartment or an apartment with two small rooms?
3. How about amenities? Does a built-in-kitchen, balcony or a garden increase the rent?

You can find the answer in the jupyter notebook in this repository or in this [blog post](https://ayusuftatli.com/berlin)
